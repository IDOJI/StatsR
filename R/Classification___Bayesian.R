# In this example, we create synthetic data for a binary response variable y based on a logistic regression relationship with a predictor x. We then define a Bayesian logistic regression model using the brm function. The model includes prior specifications for coefficients and residual standard deviation.
#
# After fitting the model, you can summarize the results, plot posterior distributions, and make predictions with credible intervals.
#
# Please note that this is a basic example, and you can adapt it to your specific dataset and research questions. Bayesian logistic regression allows you to incorporate prior knowledge, estimate credible intervals, and capture uncertainty in parameter estimates.
